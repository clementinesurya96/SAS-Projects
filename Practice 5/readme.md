# Practice 5 - Simulating Random Numbers & Plotting in SAS

## Introduction
The repository perform various simulations and create plots based on the given tasks. 

### Task 1: Simulations
To simulate random variables and perform statistical computations:

a. Simulate 50 values from a random variable uniformly distributed between 0 and 30.

b. Simulate 50 values from an exponentially distributed random variable with a rate parameter of 5. 

c. Simulate 50 values from a binomial experiment with 8 trials and a success probability of 0.4 on each trial. 

d. Simulate 50 values from a Poisson-distributed random variable with a mean of 2.5. 

### Task 2: Plotting
With in-built dataset HEART. Then:

a. Create a plot displaying two histograms: the first for the height of female participants and 
the second for the height of male participants in the dataset. 

b. Create a second plot showing two barcharts: the first representing the blood pressure status of female participants 
and the second representing the blood pressure status of male participants. 


Feel free to explore the code and make any necessary modifications to suit your needs. Happy coding!
