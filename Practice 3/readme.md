# Practice 3 - Manipulating Character Variables

## Introduction:
This SAS programming practice focuses on utilizing the DEMOGRAPHICS dataset from the SASHELP library to perform various tasks. 

## Task:

a. Modifying the ISONAME Variable:

Write a SAS step to change the ISONAME variable so that only the first letters are capitalized. 

b. Replacing REGION Values:

Write a SAS step to replace the REGION values with the corresponding full words. 
For example, AMR should be replaced with America. 

c. Creating the NAME2 Variable:

Write a SAS step to create a variable called NAME2, which contains the NAME variable but with all spaces and the special character "/" removed. 

d. Calculating the Length of NAME2:

Create a variable called LEN, which records the length of the NAME2 variable for each country. 
Use the MEANS procedure to find the minimum and maximum length recorded in this variable. 

e. Manipulating ISONAME to Create FIRST_LAST:

Remove the first character and the final character from ISONAME and concatenate them into a string of length 2. 
Store this in a new variable called FIRST LAST, ensuring that all letters in this new variable are capitalized. 

f. Ordering the Dataset by FIRST_LAST:

Use SAS code to order the dataset alphabetically by the FIRST LAST variable. 
Determine the observation in the fifth row. 

g. Creating a Frequency Table for FIRST LAST:

Create a frequency table for the FIRST LAST variable. Determine if there are observations that appear more than once or 
if every two-letter string is unique. 

Enjoy practicing your SAS programming skills and feel free to modify or expand upon these tasks based on your learning goals. 

Happy coding!
