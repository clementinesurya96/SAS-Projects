# Introduction:
This SAS programming practice focuses on utilizing the CARS dataset from the SASHELP library to perform various tasks. 
Instead of relying on point-and-click routines, we write SAS code to accomplish each task. 

# Practice Task:

a. Write a PROC step to view the contents of the CARS dataset:

Make sure the variables are sorted in the order in which they appear in the table.

b. Creating a Report for the 40th to 60th Row:

Write SAS code to create a report that displays the 40th to 60th row of the CARS dataset. 

c. Creating a Report for Cars with Engine Size > 3 Litres:

Write SAS code to generate a report containing only the cars from the CARS dataset that have an engine size greater than 3 litres. 

d. Creating a Report for Cars with Engine Size > 3 Litres and Horsepower > 250:

Write SAS code to create a report that includes only the cars from the CARS dataset with an engine size greater than 3 litres and a 
horsepower greater than 250. 

e. Creating a Report for Cars with Engine Size > 3 Litres, Horsepower > 250, and Setting Car Make as ID:

Write SAS code to generate a report that contains only the cars from the CARS dataset with an engine size greater than 3 litres, 
horsepower greater than 250, and set the car make as the ID. 

Enjoy practicing your SAS programming skills and feel free to modify or expand upon these tasks based on your learning goals. Happy coding!
